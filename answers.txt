What is the difference between git add and git commit?
git add stages the changes to be committed and git commit permanently saves the 
changes.

What happens if you delete the .git folder?
You lose your change history and other components of version control.

Why should you never share your private key (id_rsa)?
Sharing your private key would allow someone to make changes to your files as if
they were you. At best, this would be confusing as you wouldn't be able to tell
who really made a change. At worst, someone could impersonate you, perhaps with 
nefarious purposes.
